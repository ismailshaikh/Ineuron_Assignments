    "1. Python's Object Oriented Programming (OOP) allow programmers to create reusable and modular code by organizing data and functionality into objects which can be instantiated and manipulated.\n",
    "2. The main purpose of python's oop is to provide a way to structure code in a way that makes it easier to manage and maintain over time."

    "\n",
    "1. In Inheritance if subclass does not have an attribute python will first look for the attribute in the subclass's dictionary. \n",
    "2. if the attribute is not found in the subclass's dictionary, python will look for the attribute in the superclass's dictionary.\n",
    "3. if the attribute is still not found in the superclass's dictionary python will continue up the inheritance chain looking for the attribute in each successive superclass's dictionary until it either finds the attribute or reaches the top of the inheritance chain (i.e. root object class) this process is called Method Resolution Order (MRO)\n",
    "4. the MRO can be accessed using the built-in mro() method on a class."

    "\n",
    "1. In Python, a Class Object is a Blueprint for creating Instances, while an Instance Object is a Specific Object is created From a Class.\n",
    "2.  **CREATION:** Class Object is created when the **'class'** keyword is used to define a new class , and Instance Object is created by calling the class, which creates a new instance of the class.\n",
    "3. **ACCESS:** Class object are accessed through the class name while instance objects are accessed through an instance variable.\n",
    "4. **ATTRIBUTES:** Class objects can have class-level Attributes which shared by all instances of the class. Instance objects can have instance-level Attributees which are specific to each instance of the classs.\n",
    "5. **'self' PARAMETER:** WHen method is define in class the first paramete is usually 'self',which refer to the instance object that the method is being called on. Class Level methods does not take a 'self' parameter.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. In Python, the first argument in a class's method function is conventionally named \"self\" and refers to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. This argument is special because it allows the method to access and modify the object's attributes and call other methods within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A class method is similar to an instance method, but it has a class object passed as its first argument. Recall that, when an instance method is called from an instance object, that instance object is automatically passed as the first argument to the method.\n"

    "2. **Define the Constructor:** The constructor is a special method called '___init__ _'** that is called when an object of the class is created. inside the constructor you can initialize the object's attribute\n",
